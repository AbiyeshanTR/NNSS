# Stable-by-Design Neural Network-Based LPV State-Space Models for System Identification

This branch contains:
- Trained NN-SS models
- SIMBa and classical subspace models
- Models trained on Powerplant, Robot Arm, and Two-Tank benchmarks

The main branch is intentionally kept lightweight and contains **only the source code** required to reproduce the results.  

Users can either:
- Download the pretrained models from this dedicated branch, or   
- Retrain all models using the provided training scripts.

This structure ensures reproducibility while complying with GitHub storage constraints.
